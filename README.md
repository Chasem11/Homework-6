# Web Development Project 6 - *Pokemon Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Chase Moffat**

This web app: My project is a dashboard that displays all of the first generation Pokemon. My project makes a call to the Pokemon API and displays cards that show the Pokemons
name, imagen and type. When the user clicks on the pokemons name they are redirected to a new page to view the pokemons card. On the unique pokemon page users can view the pokemons
HP, stats, and type. On the main page of my porject there is a donut chart. This chart shows the distribution of pokemon types as a way to visuilize which types are  most common. 
My project also has search functionality. Users can directly search for a specific Pokemon by typing their name into the search bar. Users can also filter through Pokemon by type 
or HP. My project also displays summary stats. These stats show the total Pokemon, average base experiance, median HP, and most common type for the Pokemon that are currently displayed on the dashboard.

Time spent: **4.5** hours spent in total
